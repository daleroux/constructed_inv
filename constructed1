Filter by group, 
A cleaner approach would be have the playbook run against the group with "hosts = account_1234"
But it's also possible to create the 'target_group' so that it's same hosts as group 'account_1234'

A Smart inventory doesn't preserve the groups from the inventories


plugin: constructed
strict: true
groups:
  target_group: group_names | intersect (['account_1234'])
