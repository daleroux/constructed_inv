Filter by group, 
The traditional approach would be have the playbook run against the group with "hosts = account_1234"
But constructed inventories allows us to reference magic variable such as "group_names" 
apply a filter to it, so this is that functionality we demonstrate here

A Smart inventory doesn't preserve the groups from the inventories


plugin: constructed
strict: true
groups:
  target_group: group_names | intersect (['account_1234'])
