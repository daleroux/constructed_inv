# constructed_inv

This repository contains two inventories under issues/AWX371
Those are based from Alan Rominger's gitub repo: 
https://github.com/AlanCoding/Ansible-inventory-file-examples

I modified Alan's inventory to reflect my existing RHEL7 and 8 test systems

There are also 5 examples of constructed inventories: constructed[1-5]

As well as two playbooks: 'cache_facts.yml' and 'set_facts.yml'
