# constructed_inv

This repository contains two inventories under issues/AWX371
Those are based from Alan Rominger's gitub repo: 
https://github.com/AlanCoding/Ansible-inventory-file-examples
and inspired by his blog post:
https://www.ansible.com/blog/how-to-use-the-new-constructed-inventory-feature-in-aap-2.4

I modified Alan's inventory to reflect my existing RHEL7 and 8 test systems

There are also 5 examples of constructed inventories: constructed[1-5]

As well as two playbooks: 'cache_facts.yml' and 'set_facts.yml'
